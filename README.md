Effort: Easy-Medium
Deadline: 6h
Difficulties/learning points:

Use dw.catalog.ProductSearchModel() to retrieve and sort products from the category
Use isloop tag to iterate products inside .isml template
Objective:

Create a new template to be used in PDP that displays 4 products which belong to the same primary category as the current product and are sorted from 

the lowest price to the highest.

HINTS

You don't need to create a new controller here. Instead, make use of the new append function to extend an existing controller.
Check how to make use of getViewData and setViewData.
To access the parameter you send to the controller via remote include you must use the request object instance (Check Request Class on Documentation Demandware).
